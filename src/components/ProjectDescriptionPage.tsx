          The goal of this project was to train multiple Artificial Neural
          Networks (ANNs) to predict the closing stock prices of various
          companies. These predictions are hosted on the cloud, allowing others
          to access and view them. This project is purely experimental and
          should not be considered financial advice.

        <p className="max-w-prose text-lg ">
          The initial plan for the project was to use Flask, a lightweight
          Python web framework, to load the models and generate predictions. The
          Flask app would run on an AWS EC2 instance, with the models and data
          stored in AWS S3. However, using a persistent server quickly proved
          inefficient for two main reasons: first, obtaining an instance with
          sufficient compute power for model inference was costly; second,
          predictions only needed to be made once per day, so storing them was
          more efficient than generating a new prediction every time a user
          visited the webpage. Instead, I switched to using an AWS Lambda
          function, which is triggered after market close to make predictions
          for the following trading day. The entire architecture is shown in
          Figure 1 below.

              I used the Alpha Vantage API to collect stock price data. The API
              call returned key data points including time_stamp, open, close,
              and volume for the entire trading history of each company. Using
              this data, I engineered additional features to enhance the model's
              training process.

              I calculated many technical indicators to provide my features for

              I used PyTorch to train the LSTM models, loading a configuration
              file that contained a list of hyperparameters I tuned to enhance
              model performance. The hyperparameters included batch size, number
              of epochs, learning rate, hidden dimensions, and the number of
              layers. I implemented an early stopping strategy to halt training
              when performance stagnated, adjusting the patience and minimum
              delta variables accordingly. While I applied the same architecture
              across all companies, this decision may not have optimized
              performance; in the future, I plan to develop architecture
              tailored to each companyâ€™s dataset.

            <p className="max-w-prose text-lg ">
              For model training, I employed a moving window technique, where
              the model was trained on the most recently gathered data. This
              approach helps prevent the models from overfitting to outdated
              data, which often reflects significantly lower stock prices.
              Additionally, I utilized cross-validation on the training window
              to assess the model's performance across various segments of the
              data.
